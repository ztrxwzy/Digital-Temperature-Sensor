# 🌡️ Digital Thermometer with Arduino UNO

An environmental temperature measurement system with **16x2 LCD display** and **LEDs** indicators, all powered by an Arduino UNO.
This was my first project in electronics, and it marked the beginning of my journey into hardware.
**Zero experience, but a thousand desires** 🚀.

## 🔧 What does this project do?

- Reads the ambient temperature using a **LM35DZ sensor**.
- Displays temperature on **16x2 LCD display** with I2C module.
- Uses **LEDs** to alert on temperatures out of normal range.
- It is intended to be portable and, in the future, powered by **rechargeable battery**.
