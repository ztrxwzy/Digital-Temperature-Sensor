# 🌡️ Project: Digital Thermometer with Arduino UNO

An environmental temperature measurement system with **16x2 LCD display** and **LEDs** indicators, all powered by an Arduino UNO.
This was my first project in electronics, and it marked the beginning of my journey into hardware.
**Zero experience, but a thousand desires** 🚀.
